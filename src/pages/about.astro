    <p>
        I am a Junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and
        (tentatively) physics. My chief interests are in low-level systems,
        physical simulation, privacy in the age of mass data collection, and
        esoteric happenings. My main time sink outside of academics is Brown
        Space Engineering, which I currently co-lead with Milan Capoor. 
        I've done some hackin on Binary Ninja, mostly improving decompilation
        accuracy and UI/UX.

        I've got some cool networking projects in the works! More to come!
