    <p>
        I am a Junior at Brown University studying Computer Science. 
        My chief interests are in communication systems,
        computer networks, privacy in the age of mass data collection, and
        esoteric happenings. My main time sink outside of academics is Brown
        Space Engineering, which I currently co-lead with Milan Capoor.
        My current research centers on making the implementation of congestion
        control algorithms less painful for networked systems researchers
        smarter than I am.
