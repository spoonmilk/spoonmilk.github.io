    I am currently in Melbourne, Florida, working as an intern at <a
      href="https://www.vector35.com/"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Vector 35</a
    >. It's an excellent workplace full of remarkably intelligent and experienced
    people. It's funny, going from almost no reverse engineering experience to
    working at a company that makes reverse engineering tools. So much to learn!  </p>
