    This is the personal website of Alex Khosrowshahi, a second-year Computer
    Science/Physics student at Brown University. On most tech-related sites, I
    go by the username <b>spoonmilk</b>.
    <br />
    <br />
    This site is still largely under construction. It is made with the static site
    generator
    <a href="https://astro.build" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"
      >Astro</a
    >, which lets me do some fancy client routing while keeping all the visible
    elements rather bare. Blog coming soon.
